Final Vs Const

Constancy	                    Runtime constant	                                        Compile-time constant
Initialization timing	        During variable access or constructor                     During compilation
Value type	                  Can be any expression	                                    Must be a compile-time constant

```
class User {
  final String name;

  User(this.name) {
    // final variable can be initialized in the constructor
  }

  final int age = calculateAge(); // This is allowed with final, but not const

  int calculateAge() {
    // Simulates calculating age based on some logic
    return 30;
  }
}
```


```
const double pi = 3.14159; // Compile-time constant value

const int maxRetries = 3; // Another compile-time constant

const Color backgroundColor = Colors.blue; // Constant color reference
```
